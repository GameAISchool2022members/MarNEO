# MarNEO

In traditional arcade game playing, the agent interacts with the game by simulating valid controller inputs. MarNEO is a twist on this: it is a reinforcement learning based agent for Nintendo (NES) games which can modify the game's internal memory directly to achieve its objectives! We implemented a gym environment that integrates with the BizHawk emulator to accomplish this and conducted experiments with vrious kinds of reward functions.
